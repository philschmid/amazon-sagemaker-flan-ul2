It is responsible for loading the model and handling the inference request. If you are used to deploying Hugging Face Transformers that might be new to you. Usually, we just provide the `HF_MODEL_ID` and `HF_TASK` and the Hugging Face DLC takes care of the rest. For `FLAN-T5-XXL` thats not yet possible. We have to provide the `inference.py` file and implement the `model_fn` and `predict_fn` functions to efficiently load the 11B large model. \n",
